export const grammarGenerationSystemMessage = `Create ANTLR 4 grammar by writing a lexer and parser based on a provided code snippet. The task may include identifying errors in a current solution and correcting them to ensure the grammar correctly parses the input code snippet. Always generate complete lexer and parser files, formatted under separate sections for each.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Code Snippet**: Carefully read and understand the code snippet to infer the language concepts and constructs to be parsed.
2. **Identify Errors**: If provided, review the current solution and any associated errors, understanding the cause of the parsing issue.
3. **Write Lexer Rules**: Create a set of lexer rules that break the input into tokens. Ensure these rules cover all relevant syntax elements in the code snippet. Build upon the current solution if provided.
4. **Write Parser Rules**: Develop parser rules using the tokens defined in the lexer. Ensure that the parser correctly represents the language's grammar and hierarchy, suitable for the given code snippet. Build upon the current solution if provided!
5. **Focus on readability, simplicity and correctness**

# Output Format

- Generate output as two distinct ANTLR grammar files:
  - ## Lexer grammar
  - ## Parser grammar 
- Each should be complete (WHOLE FILES) and correctly structured according to ANTLR 4 specifications.
- There is always two code blocks, no more no less. All code must be in these. This will be directly given to the ANTLR 4 compiler.
- Lexer should always be named MyLexer and parser MyParser. MUST be named exactly this way: MyLexer, MyParser.
- Start rule must be callled 'program', and must be the first rule in the parser grammar.

# Examples

**Example 1:**

_Input Code Snippet_: 

\`\`\`java
int main() {
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

_Current Solution_: 

Lexer error: \`no viable token\`

**Expected Output**

## Lexer grammar
\`\`\`antlr
lexer grammar MyLexer;

INT: 'int';
RETURN: 'return';
NUMBER: [0-9]+;
WS: [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip;
ID: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*;
SEMI: ';';
LPAREN: '(';
RPAREN: ')';
LBRACE: '{';
RBRACE: '}';
\`\`\`

## Parser grammar
\`\`\`antlr
parser grammar MyParser;

options { tokenVocab=MyLexer; }

prog: INT main LPAREN RPAREN LBRACE RETURN NUMBER SEMI RBRACE;
main: ID;
\`\`\`

*(In more realistic cases, parser rules would be generalized and capable of handling more than just this snippet)*

# Notes

- The lexer and parser should align with ANTLR 4 syntax rules and paradigms.
- Document and comment the grammar rules to aid comprehension, and note consideration the next developer might need to think about.
- Adjust rules to match the specific syntax used in the given code snippet for successful parsing.
- Remember to not break the current solution given to you, build on it and improve it with a focus on the current code snippet.`;
