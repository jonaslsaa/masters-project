export const grammarGenerationSystemMessage = `Create ANTLR 4 grammar by writing a lexer and parser based on a provided code snippet. The task may include identifying errors in a current solution and correcting them to ensure the grammar correctly parses the input code snippet. Always generate complete lexer and parser files, formatted under separate sections for each.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Code Snippet**: Carefully read and understand the code snippet to infer the language concepts and constructs to be parsed.
2. **Identify Errors**: If provided, review the current solution and any associated errors, understanding the cause of the parsing issue.
3. **Write Lexer Rules**: Create a set of lexer rules that break the input into tokens. Ensure these rules cover all relevant syntax elements in the code snippet. Build upon the current solution if provided.
4. **Write Parser Rules**: Develop parser rules using the tokens defined in the lexer. Ensure that the parser correctly represents the language's grammar and hierarchy, suitable for the given code snippet. Build upon the current solution if provided!
5. **Focus on readability, simplicity and correctness**
6. MUST be made in a general way, so that the next snippet which might give new information can be integrated into the grammar.

# Output Format

- Generate output as two distinct ANTLR grammar files:
  - ## Lexer grammar
  - ## Parser grammar 
- Each should be complete (WHOLE FILES) and correctly structured according to ANTLR 4 specifications.
- There is always two code blocks, no more no less. All code must be in these. This will be directly given to the ANTLR 4 compiler.
- Lexer should always be named MyLexer and parser MyParser. MUST be named exactly this way: MyLexer, MyParser.
- Start rule must be callled 'program', and must be the first rule in the parser grammar.
- Make it as general as possible, so that the next snippet which might give new information can be integrated into the grammar.
- skip : Whitespace and comments should be skipped!

# Examples

**Example 1:**

_Input Code Snippet_: 

\`\`\`
int main() {
    return 0; // Return 0
}
\`\`\`

_Current Solution_: 

warning: 16:17: implicit definition of token COMMA in parser

**Expected Output**

Ah, good catch! Let me think through this step by step:

1. The error occurs because we're using COMMA in the parser grammar (in parameterList rule) but haven't defined it in the lexer grammar
2. We should always check that every token used in the parser has a corresponding definition in the lexer
3. Looking at our current lexer grammar:
  - We have basic punctuation like LPAREN, RPAREN, SEMI
  - But we forgot COMMA!
4. Other potential tokens we might be missing:
  - Operators like PLUS, MINUS, etc. might be useful
  - Assignment operator (=) could be needed
5. Let's fix the COMMA issue and add some common operators while we're at it

## Lexer grammar
\`\`\`antlr
lexer grammar MyLexer;
// Keywords
INT: 'int';
RETURN: 'return';
VOID: 'void';
// Literals
INTEGER_LITERAL: [0-9]+;
// Identifiers
IDENTIFIER: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*;
// Operators and punctuation
LPAREN: '(';
RPAREN: ')';
LBRACE: '{';
RBRACE: '}';
SEMI: ';';
COMMA: ',';
// Comments
SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT: '//' ~[\r\n]* -> skip;
MULTI_LINE_COMMENT: '/*' .*? '*/' -> skip;
// Whitespace
WS: [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip;
\`\`\`

## Parser grammar
\`\`\`antlr
parser grammar MyParser;
options { tokenVocab = MyLexer; }
program
    : functionDeclaration*
    ;
// Function declaration
functionDeclaration
    : typeSpecifier IDENTIFIER LPAREN parameterList? RPAREN functionBody
    ;
// Parameter list (can be empty)
parameterList
    : parameter (COMMA parameter)*
    | VOID
    ;
parameter
    : typeSpecifier IDENTIFIER
    ;
// Function body
functionBody
    : LBRACE statement* RBRACE
    ;
// Statements
statement
    : returnStatement
    | expressionStatement
    ;
returnStatement
    : RETURN expression? SEMI
    ;
expressionStatement
    : expression SEMI
    ;
// Expressions
expression
    : INTEGER_LITERAL
    | IDENTIFIER
    ;
// Type specifiers
typeSpecifier
    : INT
    | VOID
    ;
\`\`\`

# Notes
- The lexer and parser should align with ANTLR 4 syntax rules and paradigms.
- Document and comment the grammar rules to aid comprehension, and note consideration the next developer might need to think about.
- Adjust rules to match the specific syntax used in the given code snippet for successful parsing.
- No explanations are needed after the solution is given, just write the solution.
- Remember to not break the current solution given to you, build on it and improve it with a focus on the current code snippet.`;
